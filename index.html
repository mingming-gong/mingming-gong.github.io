        I am the co-founder and co-director of <a href="http://melb-clear.group">UoM Causal Learning & Reasoning Group</a> and the <a href="http://mdlg.ai">Melbourne Deep Learning Group</a>.  Before joining UoM, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, working with <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/kayhan"> Prof Kayhan Batmanghelich</a> and <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html">Prof Kun Zhang</a>. 
        I obtained my PhD from <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">University of Technology Sydney</a>, supervised by <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/dacheng.tao.php">Prof Dacheng Tao</a> and co-supervised by <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html">Prof Kun Zhang</a>,  Master degree from <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn/">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>, and bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/">Nanjing University</a>.

    <li><p> To potential PhD/MPhil students. I accept PhD/MPhil students at both UoM and MBZUAI. Feel free to contact me if you plan to do research on machine learning for your PhD's thesis. Full scholarships will be provided for talented PhD applicants. </li>
    <li><p>To UoM Master by Coursework students. Please contact me if you plan to do research on machine learning for your Master's thesis. I supervise students from data science, statistics, and computer science. I prefer to mentor students who are genuinely committed to pursuing a research career.
    <!-- <li><p>To UoM undergraduate students. I typically supervise one student on the <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/scie30001">Science Research Project (SCIE30001)</a> each year. You should have good GPA (math and computing courses) and Python coding experience.</p></li> -->
    <li><p>To undergraduate students. Due to my current heavy supervisory commitments, I am unable to take on undergraduate students at this time. </p></li>

    <h2><hr><a name="research"></a>Research Interests</h2>
     <p>

I am dedicated to providing theoretical foundations and computational innovations in understanding the generative process of real-world complex data. My research focuses on two levels of generative models. The first level involves learning from observational data distributions to sample new data. The second level involves generative models that depict the underlying causal structure of the data distribution. Causal generative models go beyond mere data generation; they enable intervention in the system by manipulating variables and observing the consequences. I aim to explore the causal generative process of data to learn causal representations that are transferable, robust, and interpretable. Additionally, I am interested in designing learning models tailored for various types of real data, including but not limited to image and video data, 3D data, time series data, biological data, and multi-modal data.
